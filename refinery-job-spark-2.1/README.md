# refinery-job-spark-2.1

This module is temporary. It contains jobs moved from the refinery-job package, updated to be used with
Spark 1.6 with Scala 2.10 to Spark 2.1 with Scala 2.11.
Once all the jobs are moved, they'll move back to refinery-job with updated dependecies and this module
will be deleted.
